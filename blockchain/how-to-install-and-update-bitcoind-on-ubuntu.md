# How to install and update bitcoind on Ubuntu

## Installing bitcoind
Type the following line to add the Bitcoin Personal Package Archive (PPA) to your system:

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
```

You will be prompted for your user password. Provide it to continue. Afterwards, the following text will be displayed:

```
Stable Channel of bitcoin-qt and bitcoind for Ubuntu, and their
dependencies

Note that you should prefer to use the official binaries, where possible, to
limit trust in Launchpad/the PPA owner.

No longer supports precise, due to its ancient gcc and Boost versions.
More info: https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin
```

Press [ENTER] to continue. Type the following line to get the most recent list of packages:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

A large number of lines will be displayed as different update files are downloaded. This step may take several minutes on a slow Internet connection.
